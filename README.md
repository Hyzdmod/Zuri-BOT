# Zuri-BOT
WhatsApp bot template using baileys lib

## INFO
This template is for free, use it as u wish, copy, modify and make him better, it was originally developed for windows, I do not guarantee its full operation on other platforms, be aware of that

## INSTALLATION AND CONNECTION
first of all, I do recomend you instaling baileys edge version by using

```bash
npm i https://github.com/adiwajshing/Baileys
```
*(You must have git installed on your computer)*


Installing other dependencies 

```bash
npm i
```
*(using only this method you are probably using an old version of baileys)*


Establishing connection

```bash
node start
```

## FUTURE UPDATES
This is a basic template, but its not ready yet, I'll try to update it until I fix all the problems and make it as good as my knowledge allows
